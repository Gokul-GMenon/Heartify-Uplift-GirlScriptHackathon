# Heartify



As the name signifies, Heartify is our gentle contribution to the healthcare industry. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide.
Many of us are not aware that most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, and physical inactivity using population-wide strategies. People with cardiovascular diseases need early detection and management of risk factors. The body activity of individuals has significantly reduced since the pandemic.
So, we would like to create a difference through an app that can monitor your body activity, alert you against a sedentary lifestyle and recommend exercises and diets. Moreover, we aim to help people with heart problems by early detection and prediction of heart issues through simple ML solutions.
